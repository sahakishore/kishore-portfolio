The `docker run -dp 5001:4000 --name kishore-portfolio-container --restart unless-stopped kishore-porfolio:latest` command is used to start a Docker container with specific configurations. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each part of the command and what it means, especially focusing on the port mapping:

### Breakdown of the Command

- `docker run`: This command is used to create and start a new container from a specified image.

- `-d`: This flag runs the container in detached mode, meaning it runs in the background.

- `-p 5001:4000`: This option maps ports between the host machine and the container:
  - `5001` is the port on the host machine (your computer).
  - `4000` is the port inside the container where the application is running.
  - This means that any traffic sent to `http://localhost:5001` on the host machine will be forwarded to port `4000` inside the container where the application is listening.

- `--name kishore-portfolio-container`: This option names the container `kishore-portfolio-container` for easy identification and management.

- `--restart unless-stopped`: This restart policy ensures that the container will always restart unless it is explicitly stopped. It handles situations like Docker daemon restarts or the container exiting due to an error:
  - `always`: Always restart the container if it stops.
  - `unless-stopped`: Restart the container unless it has been manually stopped.
  - `on-failure`: Restart the container only if it exits with a non-zero status.

- `kishore-porfolio:latest`: This specifies the Docker image to use for creating the container. The `:latest` tag indicates the version of the image. If `latest` is specified, Docker will use the latest version of the image available.

### Understanding Port Mapping

The port mapping `-p 5001:4000` is crucial for accessing the application running inside the Docker container from the host machine:

- **Host Port (5001)**: This is the port on your local machine. You will access your application by navigating to `http://localhost:5001` in a web browser or via any other network requests.
- **Container Port (4000)**: This is the port inside the Docker container where the application (e.g., a web server) is listening for incoming requests.

### Example Scenario

If you have a React application (or any other web application) running on port `4000` inside the Docker container, by specifying `-p 5001:4000`, you are telling Docker to map port `5001` on your host machine to port `4000` inside the container. This way, when you access `http://localhost:5001`, Docker forwards the request to the application running on port `4000` inside the container.

This setup is especially useful for ensuring that your application is accessible from the host machine without directly exposing the container's internal port to the outside world. It allows you to control which ports are exposed and manage multiple services running on different ports.
